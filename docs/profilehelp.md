## Anonymous login

By default your login is anonymous. By virtue of opening the page, you obtain a user id. You can set a display name and photo url for this user and it will function in every way as a proper user.

The drawback of this kind of login is that it is contingent on the browser cookie. **If you lose the cookie, you lose the login forever.** Also the login for all practical purposes is **restricted to one device**, because transferring the cookie from one device to an other is non trivial and requires expertise.

## Unverified email login

To obtain an unverified email login provide and email and a password and then press "Sign up". The email need not be a working email box, yet it has to formally look like an email adress ( "foobar" is not good, "foo@bar.com" is good ). You can then log in with your email credentials using the "Sign in" button. This form of login is portable from one device to an other.

Drawback of this kind of login is that you **can't verify your account and cannot reset your password once you forget it**.
